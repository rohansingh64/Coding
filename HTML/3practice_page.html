    <h1>Maharana Pratap Singh</h1>
    <p>
        <h2><u id="1">Early life and accession</u></h2>
        <p>Maharana Pratap was born to Udai Singh II of Mewar and Jaiwanta Bai in 1540, the
            year in which Udai Singh ascended to the throne after defeating Vanvir Singh.[5][6][7] His younger
            brothers were Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. Pratap also had two stepsisters: Chand 
            Kanwar and Man Kanwar. His chief consort was Ajabde Bai Punwar of Bijolia.[8] Their eldest son was 
            Amar Singh I.[9] He belonged to the royal family of Mewar.[10] After the death of Udai Singh in 1572, 
            Rani Dheer Bai Bhatiyani wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him[11] but senior courtiers preferred 
            Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the nobles prevailed and Pratap ascended 
            the throne as Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in the line of the Sisodia Rajputs.[12] 
            He was crowned in Gogunda on the auspicious day of Holi. Jagmal swore revenge and left for Ajmer, to 
            join the armies of Emperor Akbar. He was given the town
            of Jahazpur as a Jagir as a gift in return for his help.[13]</p>

        <h2><u id="2">Military career</u></h2>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Pratap Singh, gained distinction for his refusal to form any political alliance with the 
            Mughal Empire and his resistance to Mughal domination.
            The conflicts between Pratap Singh and Akbar led to the Battle of Haldighati.</p>
            <h4>Battle of Haldighati</h4>
            <p>The Siege of Chittorgarh in 1567-1568 had led to the loss of the 
                fertile eastern belt of Mewar to the Mughals. However, the rest of the wooded and hilly kingdom 
                in the Aravalli range was still under the control of Maharana Pratap. Mughal Emperor 
                Akbar was intent on securing a stable route to Gujarat through Mewar; when Pratap Singh was 
                crowned king (Maharana) in 1572, Akbar sent a number of envoys, including one by Raja Man Singh 
                I of Amer, entreating him to become a vassal like many other rulers in Rajputana. When Pratap refused 
                to personally submit to Akbar and several attempts to diplomatically settle the issue failed, 
                war became inevitable</p> 
                <h4>Post-Haldighati Mughal invasions</h4>
                <p>Shahbaz Khan Kamboh led multiple invasions that resulted 
                    in the subjugation of key areas in Mewar, such as Kumbhalgarh, Mandalgarh,
                    Gogunda, and Central Mewar, bringing them permanently under Mughal rule. The Mughal 
                    Empire established its supremacy in Mewar after Shahbaz Khan's invasions. This ultimately 
                    led to a significant weakening of Pratap's power, forcing him to retreat to his hilly abode.</p>    
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2><u id="3">Patronage of art</u></h2>
        <p>Maharana Pratap's court at Chavand had given shelter to many poets, artists, writers and artisans.
            The Chavand school of art was developed during 
            the reign of Rana Pratap. He also had renowned artists like Nasiruddin in his court.</p>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2><u id="4">Revival of Mewar</u></h2>
        <p>Mughal pressure on Mewar relaxed after 1579 following 
            rebellions in Bengal and Bihar and Mirza Hakim's incursion into the Punjab. 
            After this Akbar sent Jagannath Kachhwaha to invade Mewar in 1584. This time too Mewar 
            army defeated Mughals and forced them to retreat. In 1585, Akbar moved to Lahore and remained 
            there for the next twelve years watching the situation in the north-west. No major 
            Mughal expedition was sent to Mewar during this period.[25] Taking advantage of 
            the situation, Pratap recovered some of Mughal occupied areas of Mewar and captured 
            thirty-six Mughal outposts. Udaipur, Mohi, Gogunda, Mandal and Pandwara were some of 
            the important areas that were recaptured from this conflict. According to the 1588 inscription 
            near Jahazpur, the Rana gave the lands of Pander to a trusted follower called 
            Sadulnath Trivedi. G.N. Sharma claims that the Pander inscription is proof that 
            the Rana had occupied north-eastern Mewar and was granting lands to those who had 
            been loyal to him.[25][26] From 1585 till his death, the Rana had recovered a large 
            part of Mewar. The citizens who had migrated out of Mewar started returning during this time. 
            There was good monsoon which helped to revive the agriculture of Mewar. The economy also started 
            getting better and trade in the area started increasing. The Rana was
            able to capture the territories around Chittor but could not fulfill his dream of 
            capturing Chittor itself.</p>
    </p>


    <p>
        <h2><u id="5">Death</u></h2>
        <p>Reportedly, Pratap died of injuries sustained in a hunting accident,
            at Chavand[25] on 19 January 1597, aged 56.
            He was succeeded by his eldest son, Amar Singh I. On his death bed, 
            Pratap told his son never to submit to the Mughals and to win Chittor back.
            It is said that even Akbar was shocked to hear the news of Maharana Pratap's death. 
            Dursa Arha, the court poet of Akbar, is said to have eulogised Maharana Pratap in the Mughal court.</p>
